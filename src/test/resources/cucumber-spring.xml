        NOTE: I believe the way in which the cucumber-spring code works is that
        it intercepts Cucumbers-JVM's normal mechanism for creating instances of 
        step definition files.  I'm pretty sure therefore, that this means that 
        any beans we use need to be instantiated by Spring and form part of the 
        tree of objects created from step definitions.  So you can't go around 
        creating objects using new or expect things to be wired if they aren't 
        created as part of the beans needed for the step definitions (which is
        unlikely as you wouldn't be using anything that wasn't part of a step).

    <!-- 
        Scan the given package and look for @Components to add to the Spring context.
        
        This saves us having to create bean entries for everything in this config file
        when we just want to plug components together.
